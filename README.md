# users-portal

This is a sample application to add/ browse the users on the client side. The users list are stored in the browser local storage (if available).

The module UI Router is used to navigate between the two screens (1. Add user 2. Browse user list). 

Two controllers in addition to the main controller are used to manage the view of the two screens

One common service is used to share the user list among the controllers.

The code for routing, controllers, service is written in the app.js

For better design, bootstrap and font-awesome are used
